description: Regarded as one of Trollope's most idyllic novels, RACHEL RAY is a wonderful
  study of the unremarkable. In the rural town of Baslehurst, in Devon, Luke Rowan
  is attempting to wrest control of the brewery from the ageing Mr Tappitt. At the
  same time, he is courting Rachel Ray, a local beauty. Around these two circumstances
  is built a gallery of events, none of which is an incident that "would be even remarkable
  in everyday life", yet which add up to an engrossing study of people and their relationships
  with one another.
